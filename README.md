Horse Code
==========
Because there are two horse emoji, one is short, one is long, and horse rhymes with morse.
Issues (pull requests welcome):
 * Currently one way, decoding to come.
 * Site styling is bad because I'm bad at it.
 * Unknown characters are encoded as unicorns, this is cool but has the drawback of not being widely rendered and completely un-decodable.
